# UFOS
Using Javascript, bootstrap to make a UFO sightings page.

## Overview of the Project
For this project we are building an HTML page that will allow us to pull up information from a javascript data file using filters on the page. We want to use filters since we have many different sightings that occurred throughout the U.S.based on the different areas or what type of shape of the sighting.

## HTML Page 


## Summary :
### Drawback 
The user must know specific dates, cities, or shapes to search. Some shapes like "light" might not be as intuitive. The filters require correct lower-case spellings and cannot include spaces at the end. 
### Recomendations 
* A recommended filters update  should be to add a trim function to catch spaces at the end of words as well as allow for upper and lower cases.
